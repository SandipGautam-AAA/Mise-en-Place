# Mise en Place

> **"Everything in its place."**

## The Inital Concept
**Mise en Place** is a game centered on the art of preparation. It explores the meditative yet disciplined workflow of a professional kitchen, where the challenge lies not just in the cooking, but in the organization, timing, and precision of the workspace.

In a high-pressure environment, your success is determined by how well you prepare your station before the first order ever hits the rail.

## Core Pillars
* **Organization:** Curate and arrange your workspace for maximum efficiency.
* **Precision:** Master the technical skills of preparation—chopping, weighing, and sorting.
* **Flow:** Maintain a rhythmic "state of flow" to stay ahead of the clock.
* **Minimalism:** Focus on the essential tools and ingredients; distractions are the enemy of a clean service.
